## Motivation

As a home brewer CO2 is the gas of choice for most purposes, including pushing beverages to the tap. But sometimes you don't want to just serve beer but also coldbrew coffee and other non-carbonated beverages. In most cases a simple N2 cylinder does the job but given that air is 78% nitrogen why not just extract it from the air?

## Scope and scale

Typically a home brewer will not need a lot of nitrogen. Most commerical large scale nitrogen generation equipment is built for continious N2 blanketing and is optimized for that use case. We therfore need to carefully consider what our goals are:
